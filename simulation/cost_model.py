Rule-based cost, deployment speed, and feasibility model for every intervention.

DECISION DOCUMENTATION
=======================
All values here are deterministic rule-based assignments, not ML predictions.
Every number has an explicit source or reasoning documented inline.

COST ASSIGNMENT LOGIC
---------------------
Cost is expressed in ₹ Crore per percentage point of intensity deployed
across an average district (~2 lakh households, ~5 GPs, ~200 km²).

Basis for cost-per-point values:
  Tower Deployment:
    BharatNet Phase-II capex: ₹25-30 Cr per 1000 GPs for towers + backhaul.
    An average district has ~200 GPs. ₹5-6 Cr per district at full deployment.
    Cost per intensity point (1% of 100%) = ₹0.05-0.06 Cr ≈ ₹0.06 Cr/pt.

  Fibre Backhaul:
    OFC fiberisation: ~₹3-5 lakh per km. A district needs ~500 km medium-haul.
    Total ₹15-25 Cr per district at full coverage. Per point ≈ ₹0.20 Cr/pt.

  Public WiFi (PM-WANI):
    ₹2-5 lakh per hotspot, 50 hotspots per district = ₹1-2.5 Cr.
    Per point ≈ ₹0.02 Cr/pt (cheapest infrastructure intervention).

  Device Subsidy:
    ₹2,500-3,500 per device, ~30k BPL HH per district targeted at full sat.
    Total ₹75-105 Cr at full deployment. Per point ≈ ₹0.90 Cr/pt (expensive).

  Data Subsidy:
    ₹100-200/month per HH, 12 months, 30k HH = ₹36-72 Cr/yr.
    Per point ≈ ₹0.50 Cr/pt. Recurring cost (modelled as 1-year programme).

  Digital Literacy Programme (PMGDISHA):
    ₹1,000-1,500 per trainee, ~30k trainees per district = ₹3-4.5 Cr.
    Per point ≈ ₹0.04 Cr/pt (very cost-effective).

  Women Digital Skilling:
    Same unit cost as literacy but smaller target cohort (SHG members ~20k).
    Per point ≈ ₹0.03 Cr/pt.

  Community Internet Centre (CSC):
    ₹5-10 lakh per centre, ~200 centres per district = ₹10-20 Cr.
    Per point ≈ ₹0.15 Cr/pt.

  Women's Digital Safety Infrastructure:
    181 helpline upgrades + CCTV integration: ₹0.5-2 Cr per district.
    Per point ≈ ₹0.02 Cr/pt (leverages existing infrastructure).

  SHG Microfinance + Digital Onboarding:
    NRLM revolving fund ₹15k per SHG (300 SHGs per district) = ₹4.5 Cr.
    Digital onboarding adds ₹1.5 Cr. Total ≈ ₹6 Cr. Per point ≈ ₹0.06 Cr/pt.

DEPLOYMENT SPEED LOGIC
----------------------
Speed is categorised as Fast / Medium / Slow.
Rule: based on procurement complexity + institutional readiness.

  Fast  (< 6 months to first impact):
    - Programmes with existing delivery infrastructure (CSCs, PMGDISHA, SHGs)
    - No new physical infrastructure required
    - Examples: device subsidy, data subsidy, digital literacy, women skilling,
               safety infrastructure, community internet centres

  Medium (6–18 months):
    - Requires some coordination but uses established frameworks
    - Examples: public WiFi (PM-WANI PDO setup), SHG onboarding (NRLM process)

  Slow  (18–36 months):
    - New physical infrastructure: towers, fibre
    - Requires spectrum allocation, RoW clearance, contractor tendering
    - Examples: tower deployment, fibre backhaul

FEASIBILITY LOGIC
-----------------
Feasibility is carried over from engine.py (high/medium/low) based on:
  high   = single department, proven delivery model, no new legislation
  medium = multi-department coordination required
  low    = requires new legislation, spectrum issues, or major procurement

COST EFFICIENCY LOGIC
---------------------
Cost efficiency = MCI delta per ₹ Crore at 70% intensity.
Computed dynamically in optimizer.py from simulation results.
Categorical labels: HIGH (>1 pt/Cr), MEDIUM (0.3–1), LOW (<0.3).
